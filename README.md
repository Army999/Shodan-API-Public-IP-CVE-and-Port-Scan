# Shodan-API-Public-IP-CVE-and-port-scan
This script allows for 1 public ip address (you can do more if you have the proper license) to be scanned for CVE vulnerabilities and open ports. It exports the data to an CSV file that is recoverable in the Temp folder in the C:\ drive

Add your own key and the ip address you want to scan in the url at the top of the script. You can scan multiple IP addresses if you have the proper licensing and seperate the addresses like with a comma. 
Ex: https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3?key=(your key here)

You can also change the CSV save location by removing the current one at the bottom of the script and replacing it with a full file location.
